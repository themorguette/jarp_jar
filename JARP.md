# Joodeh's Archive Robot Personnel (JARP)
JARP is the discord bot of Joodeh's Archive discord server. JARP's initial purpose was to manage and save links to websites and videos 
or any other media found on the internet or created by fellow JA members, as well as be able to recall the link or media when prompted by a user;
however, we aim to implement other operations be it for convienence, automation or entertainment.

# Joodeh's Archive Robot Personnel (JARP)
JARP is the discord bot of Joodeh's Archive discord server. JARP's initial purpose was to manage and save links to websites and videos 
or any other media found on the internet or created by fellow JA members, as well as be able to recall the link or media when prompted by a user;
however, we aim to implement other operations be it for convienence, automation or entertainment.

## JARP's Command Structure
JARP commands are designed to mimic CLI command structure or syntax. Having said that, there are some slight differences between the two. Here is an example of a JARP command:

> `jarp greetings --hello`

JARP commands follow a hierarchy, where every command (Primary Operation) has its subcommand(s) (Secondary Operation(s)). Furthermore, each Secondary Operation is split into Levels,
as seen in the example above.
